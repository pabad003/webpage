                <p>Outside of academics, I have a variety of interests and activities that I pursue in my free time. One of my greatest passions is traveling and exploring different cultures and landscapes around the world. I find it incredibly enriching to immerse myself in new environments, meet people from diverse backgrounds, and broaden my perspectives through these experiences.</p>
                <p>Music is another important aspect of my life, and I often spend my leisure time playing the piano. I find solace and joy in creating music, whether it's practicing classical pieces or improvising melodies.</p>
                <p>On weekends, you'll often find me outdoors, either pounding the pavement on a morning run or trekking through scenic mountain trails. I love the sense of freedom and adventure that comes with exploring nature, and I'm constantly seeking out new trails and challenging routes to conquer.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I'm an avid windsurfer and enjoy spending time on the water whenever possible. There's something incredibly exhilarating about harnessing the power of the wind and waves, and it's a sport that keeps me energized and connected to the natural world.</p>
